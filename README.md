# Tic-Tac-toe-using-TCP-sockets
Play tic tac toe with anyone on the internet using TCP sockets. This project allows two players (host and player) to play tic tac toe from two different terminals on internet using TCP sockets. The host is a server for hosting the game, and another player can connect to the server as a client. The host listens for connections and when a player connects to the server it accepts the connections and starts the game.

## Setup
1. To connect two computers over the internet we would be using Ngrok to open up ports.
2. Go to https://ngrok.com/ sign up for a free account and follow the setup instructions on its dashboard.
3. Then open any port >9000 on localhost through ngrok and copy the IP address and port number given by ngrok to the player file.
4. Start the server.
5. Run the player file. Host has the first turn.
